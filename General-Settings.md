# Bots & Crawlers


## **What is web bot 🤖?**

A web bot is a computer program that systematically browses websites and creates indexes for them, by tracking the keywords entered on the internet. 

These bots can have a difference purpose but they operate more or less in the same manner.  [Yclas](http://yclas.com/)  allows you to prevent those bots from accessing your classifieds website or give them back their access with a single switch.

The process of collecting information from online web documents helps to reveal a website’s structure and purpose. 

Therefore, the web bots/crawlers return these results to their respective search engines whenever the keywords match the search – for example, Bing, Google or Yahoo.

## Why would I want to block the bots?

There are many reasons why webmasters and developers might want to block robots from indexing on their sites, and these include (but are not limited to):

-   The fact that, not all bots are good – some are bad and can crash your system.
-   The fact that, granting bots access can generally leave a site exposed and vulnerable.
-   Privacy, copyrights and legal issues.

However, allowing bots/crawlers to navigate your website has its advantages; particularly with regards to a great SEO (Search Engine Optimization) campaign. 

So you shouldn’t block all bots because some are ‘good’ 😇 !

## How to allow/disallow Bots and Crawlers:

When you  [create a classifieds website with Yclas](http://yclas.com/)  you can change your site's name and description very easily.

# Ads Moderation

## Ways to publish an Ad

Ads moderation is a very important feature when you want to control the amount of ads, their content or to manually avoid spammers. 
There are a few ways to moderte your ads and we are going to go through all of them:

 - Post Directly
 - Moderation On
 - Paymenet On
 - Email Confirmation On
 - Email Confirmation with Moderation On
 - Payment with Moderation

 
To configure Ads aoderation you need to go to your **Admin panel -> Settings -> General -> Moderation**

### Post directly

Post directly is a way to allow users to post new advertisements without any validation later. This means that the administrator of the page will not have obligation to activate incoming ads.

_EMAIL:_ After a user has created an advertisement, an email is sent to him. This email contains two links: one is to redirect him to his newly created ad; while the second one is to report if there’s an issue with his account.

### Moderation on

This option introduces limitation on publishing. Every new advertisement created is sent to moderation to be activated manually by administrator. This advertisement will be published with a date of activation. Until then it can be found in admin panel under moderation.

_EMAIL:_ One email is sent to user, notifying him of creation. But, in this case, he has a link that redirects him to advertisement edit. He can modify this ad, but it won’t be published until the admin activates it.

### Payment on

When the payment is active, the user is redirected to a payment gateway. But not every case. This happens only in cases in which the user have set fixed an amount of money that’s considered to be valid. Other ones are dealt like a case of “Post directly”. Example: the category “Rent a cat” have fixedan amount of 10 USD. After a user has set all the necessary fields and have clicked on button to post, he will be redirected to “Paypal”. Than he makes payment and, after this payment has been validated by “Paypal” and our back-office, his advertisement is published with the current date and time. But if the category “Rent a car” doesn’t have an amount (amount of money = 0 ), the user’s advertisement will get published with a current date and time and set on top of the list.

_EMAIL:_ One email is sent, that confirms that this advertisement is now active. Same as in “Post directly”.

### Email confirmation on

This advertisement is set to “UNCONFIRMED”. With this option every advertisement needs to be confirmed by the USER. It’s a standard way of confirming by email. The user receives an email, clicks on link that is provided and then this advertisement is validated and published. It will stay in moderation until then.

_EMAIL:_ An email is sent to the user with a link that will activate his new advertisement. NOTE: In case that this user has created advertisement while he was logged-out, after clicking the link, he will be signed up automatically.

### Email confirmation with moderation

This advertisement is set to “UNCONFIRMED”. Here, the user needs to do the email activation and then the ad is sent to moderation to be validated by the admin. This advertisement will be published with a date of activation. Until then, it can be found in admin panel under moderation.

_EMAIL:_ One email is sent to the user with a link that will activate his new advertisement and then it will be placed in moderation until the admin activates it.

### Payment with Moderation

As in the case of “payment on”, the user is redirected to payment gateway only if the product has a fixed amount. Besides, this advertisement is also processed as a “Moderation on” case. In other words, if the payment is successful, the advertisement will be sent to moderation to be once again activated by the admin. But if the posting poroess wasn’t handled with a payment, this advertisement will be set in moderation and will be waiting for the admin to activate it.

_EMAIL:_ One email is sent to user notifying him of the creation of a new ad. But, in this case, he has a link that redirects him to advertisement to edit it. He can modify this ad, but it won’t be published until the admin activates it.
