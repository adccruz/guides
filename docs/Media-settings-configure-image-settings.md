# How to configure Image Settings

The Images setting page allows you to configure a variety of settings for images uploaded to your Yclas site.  
You can modify these settings when you go to the Panel,  **Settings**  ->  **Media**.

When a user uploads an image, Yclas automatically resizes that image, changes its quality and generates a thumbnail. More details about these settings are listed below:

-   **Allowed image formats:**  Set this up to restrict image formats that are being uploaded to your server.
-   **Max image size:**  Control the size of images being uploaded. Enter an integer value to set a maximum image size in megabytes (Mb).

Each image is resized when uploaded.

-   **Image height**  (in pixels): This is the height of the big image. Note: You can leave this field blank to set AUTO height resize.
-   **Image width**  (in pixels): This is the width of the big image.

A thumb is a small image resized to fit certain elements.

-   **Thumb height**  (in pixels): This is the height of the thumb.
-   **Thumb width**  (in pixels): This is the width of the thumb.
-   **Image quality:**  Choose the quality of the stored images (1-100% of the original).
