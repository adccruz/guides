To make your categories recognisable, it is possible to add an icon to every category you have on your site. This option is available only in the  **[premium themes](https://selfhosted.yclas.com/)**. The uploaded logo appears in the  **home page**, next to the category description as shown below.



## How to do it

Adding icons to your categories is super easy! First of all, you have to create a category. If you are not sure how to do it,  [check out our useful tips](https://docs.yclas.com/how-to-add-categories).

2.  Click the button:  **Edit**  on the category you wish to update
3.  Find the field:  **Upload Category Icon**
4.  Upload your icon (note: get your icon file ready in your preferred format with the recommended dimensions of 250px by 40px)
5.  Press  **Submit**

By doing this, you will have the image inserted next to the category, at the slider small box and the full sized image after clicking on the category.
