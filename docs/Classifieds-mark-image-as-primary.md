## How it works

Let’s say you have published an ad with two images. This is how it’s displayed on the Listing page:

If you want to change the primary image, you have to click “Edit” on the ad and then click “Primary Image” under the image you want to mark as primary.

Note that you can change the primary image as many times as you'd like!
