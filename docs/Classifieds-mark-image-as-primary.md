# How to mark image as primary

-  How it works


With it, users have the option to change the **primary image** of their ad. If a user publishes an ad with five images, he can choose which image will be displayed as primary by editing the ad.  You can change the primary image as many times as you'd like.


## How it works

Let’s say you have published an ad with two images. This is how it’s displayed on the Listing page:

If you want to change the primary image, you have to click “Edit” on the ad and then click “Primary Image” under the image you want to mark as primary.
