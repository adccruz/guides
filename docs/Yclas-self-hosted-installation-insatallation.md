# Install

**How do you instal the Self-hosted version?** [](https://emojipedia.org/gear/) ⚙️

Yclas Self-Hosted installation takes *only a  few minutes.* [  ](https://emojipedia.org/hourglass-done/)⌛

You only need a compatible hosting and you will be one step away from installing the software onto your website.

If your hosting provider supports [Softaculous](https://www.softaculous.com/softwares/admanager/Yclas)  (Installer tools that you can access through your Cpanel), the installation process will take just a moment.

If your hosting provider doesn’t support Softaculous don’t worry! **Scroll down**

  Start by accessing Softaculous in your Panel and then choose the Yclas Self-Hosted in Ads management. Click on the Installation button.
