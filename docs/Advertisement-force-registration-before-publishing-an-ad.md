# How to force registration before posting a new ad?

We weren’t in favor of adding this feature to the software, but after many requests we decided to release it with our Yclas 2.1.8 . Now you are able to force your users to register before they post any ad on your website.

**To enable this feature you can follow these simple steps:**

1.  Log into your  **Admin Panel**
2.  Go to  **Settings**  >  **Advertisement**  >  **Publish Options**
3.  Set  **Require login to post**  value to  **ON**
4.  Press  **Save**

And you’re good to go!

We found that the most convenient style for a theme with this feature is  **[Newspaper theme](https://selfhosted.yclas.com/themes/newspaper.html)**  check the demo  **[here](https://selfhosted.yclas.com/themes/demo/newspaper.html)**.
