# Creating your user Database

In order to install Yclas Self-Hosted, you will need a Database and a Username.

Log in to MySQL with the root account. That‚Äôs how it will look:

> mysql -u root -p

The system will prompt you for a password. You can use your MySQL root as a password.

Now, create a database that you‚Äôll use with Yclas. We will call it yclas in the following example.

> CREATE DATABASE yclas;

Next, create a database user and assign a password. You can replace the username ycuser and the password with your own password.

> CREATE USER ycuser@localhost IDENTIFIED BY '_password_';

Next, grant permission to access the database.

> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON yclas.* TO ycuser@localhost;

Now set the new user and then reload the privileges.

> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Exit MySQL

> exit

# How to update your website?
