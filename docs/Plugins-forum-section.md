With our latest release, we added the option to have a fully functional forum section within your classifieds website. 
*Please note that it is very simple to congifure!*

**Just a few steps:**

1.  Log in to your  **Admin Panel**
2.  Go to  **Settings > Plugins**
3. In  **Forum System**  choose  **ON**  and press  **Save**  
4.  Go to  **Content > Forums** 
5. Press on  **New**
6. Fill in the required fields and press  **Create**

  Once you do that you can manage forum tabs the same way you manage categories and list them. Now your users can post in the forums.
