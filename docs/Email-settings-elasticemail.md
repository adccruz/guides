-   How it works


### How it works

Follow these simple steps to integrate ElasticEmail into your website:

1.  Set up an  **[ElasticEmail](https://j.mp/elasticemailoc)**  account
2.  Go to your panel,  **Settings**  ->  **Email**  ->  **ElasticEmail**, switch  **ElasticEmail**  to  **Enabled**.
3.  Go to your ElasticEmail account https://elasticemail.com/account#/settings -> SMTP/API and copy the  **API Key**  and  **Public Account ID**, paste to your website admin panel,  **Settings**  ->  **Email**  ->  **ElasticEmail**  and press  **Save**.
4.  Enter the  **name of the list**  that you want users to be automatically subscribed after they register. ElasticEmail provides instructions on  [how you can create a list](https://elasticemail.com/support/user-interface/contacts/lists/create-new).
5.  Press  **Save**.

Now, every e-mail you send using the admin panel will be sent through your ElasticEmail account.

That's all!
