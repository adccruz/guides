# How to manage orders

Yclas gives you the option to  _view_  and  _edit_  the orders made in your website.

When orders placed by users, they will appear on  **Panel**, then click on **Classifieds**  and go to ->  **Orders**.  _Note that only the administrator of the website has access to that area!_
