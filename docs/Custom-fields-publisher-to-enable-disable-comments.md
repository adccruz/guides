 # Publisher to enable/disable comments

Allowing users to leave comments in your website ads can drive more traffic back to your website. 

With Yclas you can add comments with **[Disqus](Publish-options-active-comments-with-disquse.md)** or **[Facebook](Publish-options-add-facebook-comments.md)** comments

This guide explains how to give publishers the option to enable or disable comments in their ads:

1.  Go to your panel,  **Classifieds -> Custom Fields**.
2.  Click  **New Field**.
3.  Itâ€™s important to call this field  **commentsdisabled**.
4.  Select  **Checkbox**  into the Type field.
5.  Fill the fields.
6.  Press  **Create**.

With  **commentsdisabled**  custom field created, publishers have the option to disable comments in their ads. If the checkbox is checked, the comments section will be disabled in the ad.
