# Reasons for your license not to work

## Why my license isn't working?

*This guide is only for Yclas Self-hosted!*

Many users ask us this question after making a purchase, setting up the software and testing it. Then they would try to use the software on their domain and they get the  **error**: “_Please insert here the license for your theme.”_

What really happens is that the user makes a purchase of one theme, which normally comes with  **one license**  that can be used on only  **one domain**. So,  **one license = one domain**. Then they would use that license on their localhost or on a test site just to see how the theme is working and when they try to get the theme working on their main website they face this issue.

**What we would recommend?**  Follow these steps after doing your first theme purchase:

-   Download your selected theme
-   Upload it to the FTP of your main website
-   Activate the license there
-   Activate  **Maintenance mode**  (**Panel > Settings > General**)
-   Do whatever tests you need
-   Deactivate maintenance mode

If you had  **already activated the license**  on a test site or on another domain, you could solve this issue by doing one of these options:

-   Purchasing an  [extra license](https://selfhosted.yclas.com/services/one-extra-license.html)
-   Purchasing  [5 licenses](https://selfhosted.yclas.com/services/theme-license-5-sites.html)
-   Purchasing  [another theme](https://selfhosted.yclas.com/themes/)  (this will give you an extra license, which you could use for another domain)

Your license can be used on any sub-domain you want to use your premium themes on but it won’t work on another domain. If you are managing more than one domain, I would definitely recommend to choose the  **extra license**  or  **5 licenses** because it is the most cost efficient.
