# How to activate black list and how it works?

The  **black list**  function  **blocks the users that published any ad you marked as spam**  from posting ever again. In simple words, you mark an ad as spam and the user who posted that ad can no longer post anything again.

**How to activate?**

1.  Log in to your  **Admin Panel**.
2.  Go to  **Settings**  >  **Plugins**.
3.  Set  **Black list**  value to  **ON**.

  Once you do that, whenever you mark an ad as spam you will receive a  **warning message**  saying that the e-mail related to the user who published that ad is now blacklisted and prevented from posting.

To see a  **full list of blacklisted users**  follow those steps:

1.  Log in to your  **Admin Panel**
2.  Go to  **Users**  >  **Black list**
