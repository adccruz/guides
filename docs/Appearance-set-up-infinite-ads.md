# How to setup infinite ads?

**Infinite ads**  is a feature we introduced to our *latest release* 2.1.4. With this feature activated you can  **see ads will be loading automatically**  whenever the user scrolls down, without the need to click on a page number or next page.

**To activate infinite scroll**  follow the next steps:

1.  Go to  **Appearance**  >  **Theme options**
2.  Change  **Infinite scroll**  to  **YES**
3.  Press  **Update**

That's all you need to do!
