## Browse ads by distance

This feature allows your users to search for products based on their distance! When using your website, users can browse the ads that are short by distance, and see how far the items are from them.

For example, your users can browse through  **items near me** , **items in a distance of 30 kilometers** or even **items in short distance** thanks to this feature.

If you want to use this feature, you need to enable:
1. [Google maps](Publish-options-configure-google-maps-settings.md)
2. [Locate the user](Plugins-auto-locate-users.md)


After enabling this feature, when a visitor browses your website, they can see how many kilometeres close to/far from them are the searched items.
