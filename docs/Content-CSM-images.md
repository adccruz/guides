# How to manage images uploaded from editor

With our latest version, itâ€™s possible to manage images that are uploaded directly from the editor. Whether you decide to upload an image on a page, blog post or forum, the image will be saved in /images/cms folder.

To manage those images, you can simply go to your **admin panel,** **Content** -> **Media**
