# How to manage images uploaded from editor

With our 2.6.0 version, itâ€™s possible to manage images that are uploaded from the editor. Whether you decide to upload an image in a page, blog post or forum, the image will be saved in /images/cms folder.

To manage those images, you can simply go to your **admin panel,**  **Content**  ->  **Media**
