# How to activate Multilingual Mode?

A new feature is included in the 3.5 version that makes it possible for you to set your website in multilingual.

**To activate Multilingual Mode:**

1.  Go to  **Admin Panel**
2.  Select  **Settings**  ->  **Regional**
3.  Set  **Multilingual**  option to  **ON**
4.  Set your  **website languages**  (a language must correspond to the ones listed on  **Settings**  ->  **Translations**). Keep in mind that you need to push enter after each language.
5.  Click  **Save**  button

Once enabled you will see on your website a language selector.
