# Bots & Crawlers


## **What is web bot 🤖?**

A web bot is a computer program that systematically browses websites and creates indexes for them, by tracking the keywords entered on the internet. 

These bots can have a difference purpose but they operate more or less in the same manner.  [Yclas](http://yclas.com/)  allows you to prevent those bots from accessing your classifieds website or give them back their access with a single switch.

The process of collecting information from online web documents helps to reveal a website’s structure and purpose. 

Therefore, the web bots/crawlers return these results to their respective search engines whenever the keywords match the search – for example, Bing, Google or Yahoo.

## Why would I want to block the bots?

There are many reasons why webmasters and developers might want to block robots from indexing on their sites, and these include (but are not limited to):

-   The fact that, not all bots are good – some are bad and can crash your system.
-   The fact that, granting bots access can generally leave a site exposed and vulnerable.
-   Privacy, copyrights and legal issues.

However, allowing bots/crawlers to navigate your website has its advantages; particularly with regards to a great SEO (Search Engine Optimization) campaign. 

So you shouldn’t block all bots because some are ‘good’ 😇 !

## How to allow/disallow Bots and Crawlers:
Let's learn how to allow/disallow these 🤖
 Follow the steps **successively**.
1.  Go to your  **website**.
2.  Login to the  **Admin Panel**.
3.  Select  **Settings -> General**.
4.  Toggle the  **Disallows (blocks) Bots and Crawlers on this website**  option ON (to  **disallow**  the bots)  
    _OR_  
    Toggle the  **Disallows (blocks) Bots and Crawlers on this website**  option OFF (to  **allow**  the bots).
    
5.  Click the  **Save**  button.

✔ **The change is successful – general configuration updated.**

Now go to your Admin Panel and continue customizing your classifieds website so that it truly serves its purpose.

When you  [create a classifieds website with Yclas](http://yclas.com/)  you can change your site's name and description very easily.

Both terms are pretty straight forward and self-explanatory.

-   Keep the length of the description field under the max (indicated by the tool tip – 160 characters).
-   Add a few keywords in the description – this could affect your SEO (Search Engine Optimization) analytics.

### How to change them step-by-step:

# Ads Moderation

## Ways to publish an Ad

Ads moderation is a very important feature when you want to control the amount of ads, their content or to manually avoid spammers. 
There are a few ways to moderte your ads and we are going to go through all of them:

 - Post Directly
 - Moderation On
 - Paymenet On
 - Email Confirmation On
 - Email Confirmation with Moderation On
 - Payment with Moderation

 
To configure Ads aoderation you need to go to your **Admin panel -> Settings -> General -> Moderation**

### Post directly

Post directly is a way to allow users to post new advertisements without any validation later. This means that the administrator of the page will not have obligation to activate incoming ads.

_EMAIL:_ After a user has created an advertisement, an email is sent to him. This email contains two links: one is to redirect him to his newly created ad; while the second one is to report if there’s an issue with his account.

### Moderation on

This option introduces limitation on publishing. Every new advertisement created is sent to moderation to be activated manually by administrator. This advertisement will be published with a date of activation. Until then it can be found in admin panel under moderation.

_EMAIL:_ One email is sent to user, notifying him of creation. But, in this case, he has a link that redirects him to advertisement edit. He can modify this ad, but it won’t be published until the admin activates it.

### Payment on

When the payment is active, the user is redirected to a payment gateway. But not every case. This happens only in cases in which the user have set fixed an amount of money that’s considered to be valid. Other ones are dealt like a case of “Post directly”. Example: the category “Rent a cat” have fixedan amount of 10 USD. After a user has set all the necessary fields and have clicked on button to post, he will be redirected to “Paypal”. Than he makes payment and, after this payment has been validated by “Paypal” and our back-office, his advertisement is published with the current date and time. But if the category “Rent a car” doesn’t have an amount (amount of money = 0 ), the user’s advertisement will get published with a current date and time and set on top of the list.

_EMAIL:_ One email is sent, that confirms that this advertisement is now active. Same as in “Post directly”.

### Email confirmation on

This advertisement is set to “UNCONFIRMED”. With this option every advertisement needs to be confirmed by the USER. It’s a standard way of confirming by email. The user receives an email, clicks on link that is provided and then this advertisement is validated and published. It will stay in moderation until then.

_EMAIL:_ An email is sent to the user with a link that will activate his new advertisement. NOTE: In case that this user has created advertisement while he was logged-out, after clicking the link, he will be signed up automatically.

### Email confirmation with moderation

This advertisement is set to “UNCONFIRMED”. Here, the user needs to do the email activation and then the ad is sent to moderation to be validated by the admin. This advertisement will be published with a date of activation. Until then, it can be found in admin panel under moderation.

_EMAIL:_ One email is sent to the user with a link that will activate his new advertisement and then it will be placed in moderation until the admin activates it.

### Payment with Moderation

As in the case of “payment on”, the user is redirected to payment gateway only if the product has a fixed amount. Besides, this advertisement is also processed as a “Moderation on” case. In other words, if the payment is successful, the advertisement will be sent to moderation to be once again activated by the admin. But if the posting poroess wasn’t handled with a payment, this advertisement will be set in moderation and will be waiting for the admin to activate it.

_EMAIL:_ One email is sent to user notifying him of the creation of a new ad. But, in this case, he has a link that redirects him to advertisement to edit it. He can modify this ad, but it won’t be published until the admin activates it.

## About

This is the official API Documentation for Yclas. With this API you will be able to extend the usage of your site, for example with native iOS and Android APPS. Only available for Yclas Self Hosted 2.5.0 or newer and all Yclas installations.

Contact us if you are interested to purchase the native mobile APPS  [here](https://yclas.com/contact).

### REST

This API uses REST as principle. Allowed methods are GET,POST, PUT and DELETE.

Best practices and inspiration by  [Vinay](http://www.vinaysahni.com/best-practices-for-a-pragmatic-restful-api)  and  [Simon](http://simonguest.com/2013/07/05/designing-a-web-api-for-mobile-apps/). Used  [kohana-restful-api](https://github.com/SupersonicAds/kohana-restful-api)  as code base.

NOTE: You may need to  [disable mod_security](https://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/website/modsecurity/disable-mod-security-via-modsec-manager)  to receive DELETE or PUT methods.

### Routes

We use routes similar to a crud system but they are mapped to actions internally.

Base route:  `/api/v1/<controller>(/<action>(/<id>))(.<format>`

Parameters between () are optional.

Example:  `POST /api/v1/categories/update/3`

Is the same as:  `PUT /api/v1/categories/3`

Mapping of actions:

-   GET => index
-   PUT => update
-   POST => create
-   DELETE => delete

In case you do not specify an action and you are using and ID, we swap the values internally.

### Output

The API supports different outputs. By default all will be returned as JSON but other outputs are available such:

-   JSON
-   CSV
-   XML
-   HTML

Example of usage:

-   `GET /api/v1/categories/3.xml`  get category 3 data as XML
-   `GET /api/v1/categories/3.json`  get category 3 data as JSON
-   `GET /api/v1/categories/3`  get category 3 data as JSON
-   `GET /api/v1/category.csv`  get all categories as CSV

### Result filtering, sorting & searching

This are sent as parameter (Post or Query) to the endpoint.

#### Filter

You can pass any field we indicate in the documentation, ex:

`GET /api/v1/category?id_category_parent=1&has_image=1`

This gets the categories that the parent is = 1 and have image.

Allowed operators  `>=`  (greater or equal),  `<=`  (less or equal),  `!=`  (different than) and  `__between`.

To user the operator  `__between`  the value needs to be comma separated, and the field needs to get appended  `__between`  ex:

`GET /api/v1/listings?price__between=100,303`

This will filter ads with field  `price`  bigger or equal than 100 and smaller or equal to 303.

#### Sorting

Sorting: Similar to filtering, a generic parameter sort can be used to describe sorting rules. The sort parameter takes in list of comma separated fields, each with a possible unary negative to imply descending sort order. Let’s look at some examples:

-   `GET /api/v1/listings?sort=-published`  - Retrieves a list of tickets in descending published date
-   `GET /api/v1/listings?sort=-published,title`  - Retrieves a list of ads in descending order of published date and by title of the add

#### Searching

Besides filtering on some endpoints you will be allowed to make a search using the  `q`  parameter.

`GET /api/v1/listings?q=something+to+search`

#### Pagination

You can paginate any result by using the params page (number of page) and items_per_page (elements to display).

`GET /api/v1/listings?q=something+to+search&page=3&items_per_page=10`

We return  `X-Total-Count`  header with the total amount of elements found and a header  `link`  with next,prev,last,first links.

#### Limiting fields returned

Limiting which fields are returned by the API

`GET /api/v1/listings?fields=id,subject,customer_name,updated_at&state=open&sort=-updated_at`

**Remember: You can use all this parameters together!**

`GET /api/v1/listings?q=something+to+search&status>=1&id_category=77&sort=-title,price&page=3&items_per_page=10`

----------

## Authentication

This API uses 3 different kind of endpoints. 2 are authenticated and 1 does not require any kind.

**We highly recommend usage of HTTPS to make all the request encripted and safer.**

### API Key of your installation

In order to use some api endpoint you will be required to have an API Key of your site.

To get it:

1.  Login at your classifieds site
2.  Go to Settings->General
3.  Check for API Key, thats your code you will need to make requests

That’s your  `api_key`  for your site to use in further requests. Ex:

`GET /api/v1/listing/3?apikey=ajdnasjdlk_iym`

If you have OC 2.5.1 or lower to get the api_key:

1.  Login at your classifieds site
2.  Paste in your browser  `/oc-panel/Config/update/api_key`
3.  Copy the config_value

### User API Token

Some of the API points are user based actions, so we need the specific API key  `user_token`  of the user in order to login the user for the request and filter the results.

To get it:

1.  Use  [Login User](https://docs.yclas.com/api-documentation/#login-user)  end point using your  `apikey`
2.  Store  `user_token`  somewhere safe
3.  Any future request include  `user_token=asndadnasdm`  to authenticate the user

# How to add tracking codes

-   Why you should use Google Analytics
-   Adding the Analytics Tracking ID
    -   Quick method
    -   Manual method

## Why you should use Google Analytics

It’s useful to use  [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/)  (GA) on your website for several reasons.

First of all, GA is the best because it’s free and it’s giving you much more data (who and when visits your site, etc) than any other free analytics software.

Secondly, GA makes it easy for anyone managing a site to track and analyze these data. Its custom reports allow you to see your data the way you need to see it, whenever you need it.

Lastly, everybody trusts Google Analytics data. Currently it’s in the use of around 55% of the 10,000 most popular websites and 49.95% of the top 1,000,000 websites.

## Adding the Analytics Tracking ID

### Quick method

1.  Go to  **Panel**, choose  **Settings > General**  on the left sidebar.
2.  Add your **Google Analytics Tracking ID** into the **Analytics Tracking ID field.**
3.  Press **SAVE**.

![google-analytics1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55290441/80505525-1c7b9580-897d-11ea-9610-0d335fa2406d.png)


You can change the content of the Analytics Tracking ID field whenever you want by following the same process.

### Manual method

This will work if you need to add any other tracking code, but if you have a code from your provider just use this method.

1.  Go to  **Panel**,choose  **Settings**  >  **General**  on the left sidebar.
2.  Paste your tracking code into the **HTML in HEAD element field** or into the **HTML in footer field**.
3.  Press **SAVE**

# How to set the currency format?

-   How to do it
-   List of currency formats


One of the most commonly asked question by our users is how to deal with the  **currency in which prices are displayed**. Apparently, it has caused a lot of problems and misunderstandings. This is why, with a new release (2.0.5), we decided to make some improvements in order to make it less confusing. 

 We use PHP function  **[money_format](https://php.net/manual/en/function.money-format.php)**  to solve all problems in a very easy way.

## How to do it

You can go to  **Settings**  >  **General**  >  **Regional**  and select your preferred currency. Once you press  **Save**, then the currency will show next to each amount.

# How to change date format?

**Date format**  differs from country to another and Yclas gives you the option  **to change that format according to your preferences**. This change will have an effect on all of your ads. If your website is functioning in more than one country, you will need to have different domains for each country and have separate management for each site.

**To change the date format,**  simply follow those steps:

1.  Log in to your  **Admin Panel**
2.  Go to  **Settings**  >  **General > Regional Settings**
3.  Change the field  **Date format**
4.  Press  **Update**

In case you change it to an invalid form and you want to go back to default, our default given date format is:  **d-m-y.**

If you would like to  **add hours/minutes/seconds**, you can use  **d-m-y H-i-s**. For more options about it, you can refer to  **[PHP Date/Time format](https://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php)**.

![date-format](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55290441/80508288-89445f00-8980-11ea-8457-e52bc8a55432.png)

# How to change Time Zone


It’s important to have your Time Zone correctly set up. For example, ads, orders, reviews, topics and replies on forum, blog posts etc, will not display the date or time you expect to if you don’t have the correct timezone set in your website.

To change the Time Zone, follow these steps:

1.  Go to Panel,  **Settings**  ->  **General**
2.  In the  _Regional Settings_  section,  **Time Zone**  field, select your city or the city with the same timezone as yours.
3.  Press  **Save**

# How to set up reCAPTCHA on your website

![recaptcha1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55290441/80510474-73846900-8983-11ea-839e-4503b3e909fa.png)

**reCAPTCHA**  (yes, that’s how it’s spelled), is Google’s adaption to the CAPTCHA interface. CAPTCHA is an acronym which stands for Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart. 
This free service is a computer program that is supposed to detect and distinguish automated input, generated by machines (website extraction scripts, spam bots, etc.) from humans.

In this post I will explain what the function is, how it’s different from the traditional Captcha and how to activate it on a  **[classifieds website created using Yclas](http://yclas.com/)**.

Typically the interface was based on a challenge-response type of test, that would determine whether or not the user is a human. However, the new reCAPTCHA variation (at the time of this post) makes use of an advanced risk engine, with an API that allows a significant number of your site’s valid users to ‘pass the reCAPTCHA challenge without having to solve a CAPTCHA’ – by clicking on a checkbox.

If the program is still not satisfied or sure, of whether its user has a pulse; it has the added advantage of sending out a request for that user to solve a CAPTCHA.

  
*To find out more about this service – [you can check Google’s description of the feature](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/).* 

# How does it work with Yclas?

Yclas 2.3.0 version and those that come after have made it seemingly easy to integrate this service. With the code already built into the software, all our users have to do is get a reCAPTCHA Site Key and a reCAPTCHA Secret Key.

**TIP**: Make sure that you log into Gmail or any other Google product, with the email account that you want to associate these keys with – before getting them.

You can get both from  [Google here for free](https://www.google.com/recaptcha)  when you register your site;Please use v2 of recaptcha keys.

  

# Add reCAPTCHA to your website

So you’ve registered your site with Google and now you want to see it in action, just follow these simple instructions:

1.  Go to your  **website**.
2.  Login to the  **Admin Panel**.
3.  Select  **Settings -> General -> reCaptcha**.
4.  Toggle the  **Enable reCAPTCHA as a CAPTCHA provider**  option ON.
5.  Place your website’s ‘Site Key’ in the  **reCAPTCHA Site Key**  input box. v2 of recaptcha
6.  Place your website’s ‘Secret Key’ in the  **reCAPTCHA Secret Key**  input box. v2 of recaptcha
7.  Click the  **Save**  button.
