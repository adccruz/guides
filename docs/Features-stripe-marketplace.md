# Marketplace with Stripe Connect

With  [Stripe Connect](https://stripe.com/connect)  payment gateway, you will be able to charge your customers an application fee (percentage) based on the sale they make using your platform. You (site owner) and your customer (the publisher) will need a Stripe account. For more information, read this [guide](/Payment-set-up-marketplace-with-srtipe-connect.md).
