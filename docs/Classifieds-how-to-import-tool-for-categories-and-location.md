You are building a large scale  **classifieds website**  with lots of categories and locations, but youâ€™re having a problem with adding them all in without spending so much time typing each one out.

We have the solution for you! You can use an easy import tool to add all of your locations and categories with a press of a button. You simple need to follow those steps:

**Warning:** We do not recommend adding more than 100 categories or 1000 locations if you use shared hosting. Otherwise, your website will work very slow.

2.  Go to  **Classifieds**  >  **Categories**.
3.  Click  **Import**.
4.  Upload CSV files for your categories.
